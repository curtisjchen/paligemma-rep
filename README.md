# PaliGemma Reproduction

Coding a multimodal vision language model using PyTorch. Following Google's Paligemma paper. 

The model uses a SigLip contrastive vision encoder and a linear projection layer into a pretrained LLM. This allows for efficient tokenization and understanding of images, which can be used for visual QA.
